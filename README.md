**XM SendSecure** is a collaborative file exchange platform that is both highly secure and simple to use.
It is expressly designed to allow for the secure exchange of sensitive documents via virtual SafeBoxes.

XM SendSecure comes with a **Web API**, which is **RESTful**, uses **HTTPs** and returns **JSON**.

Specific libraries have been published for various languages:
[C#](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-csharp),
[Java](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-java),
[JavaScript](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-js),
[PHP](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-php),
[Python](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-python)
and
**Ruby**.


# sendsecure-ruby

**This library allows you to use the XM SendSecure Web API via Ruby.**

With this library, you will be able to:
* Authenticate SendSecure users
* Create new SafeBoxes

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Ruby version 2.1+
- The XM SendSecure solution, provided by [XMedius](https://www.xmedius.com?source=sendsecure-ruby) (demo accounts available on demand)

## Install Package

```ruby
gem build sendsecure-ruby.gemspec
gem install sendsecure-ruby-2.0.0.gem
```

# Quick Start

## Authentication (Retrieving API Token)

Authentication is done using an API Token, which must be first obtained based on SendSecure enterprise account and user credentials.
Here is the minimum code to get such a user-based API Token (and the user ID).

```ruby
require 'sendsecure-ruby'

token_detail = SendSecure::Client.get_user_token(application_type: "The Force App", endpoint: "https://portal.xmedius.com", enterprise_account: "deathstar", username: "darthvader", password: "d@Rk$1De", device_id: "DV-TIE/x1", device_name: "TIE Advanced x1")
```

## SafeBox Creation (Using SafeBox Helper Class)

Here is the minimum required code to create a SafeBox â€“ with 1 recipient, a subject, a message and 1 attachment.
This example uses the user's *default* security profile (which requires to be set in the account).

```ruby
require 'sendsecure-ruby'

user_email = "darthvader@empire.com"
token = token_detail["token"]
user_id = token_detail["user_id"]
enterprise_account = "deathstar"
endpoint = "https://portal.xmedius.com"

client = SendSecure::Client.new(endpoint: endpoint, locale: "en", enterprise_account: enterprise_account, api_token: token, user_id: user_id)

sb = SendSecure::SafeBox.new({user_email:user_email, notification_language:"en"})
sb.subject = "Family matters"
sb.message = "Son, you will find attached the evidence."

recipient = SendSecure::Participant.new({email:"lukeskywalker@rebels.com"})
recipient.guest_options.contact_methods << SendSecure::ContactMethod.new({destination_type:"cell_phone", destination:"555-232-5334"})
sb.participants << recipient

sb.attachments << SendSecure::Attachment.new({file_path:"path/to/Birth_Certificate.pdf", content_type:"application/pdf"})

response = client.submit_safebox(sb)
```
