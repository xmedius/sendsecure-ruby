**XMediusSENDSECURE (SendSecure)** is a collaborative file exchange platform that is both highly secure and simple to use.
It is expressly designed to allow for the secured exchange of sensitive documents via virtual SafeBoxes.

SendSecure comes with a **Web API**, which is **RESTful**, uses **HTTPs** and returns **JSON**.

Specific libraries have been published for various languages:
[C#](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-csharp),

[JavaScript](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-js),
[PHP](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-php),
